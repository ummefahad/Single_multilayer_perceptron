# MNIST Digit Classification using Single and Multi-Layer Perceptrons
This project demonstrates the use of single and multi-layer perceptrons for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using TensorFlow and Keras.

# Project Overview
This project includes:

Loading and visualizing the MNIST dataset.
Preprocessing the dataset by normalizing and flattening the images.
Implementing a single-layer perceptron.
Implementing a multi-layer perceptron with two hidden layers.

# Training and evaluating the models.
Requirements
Python 3.x
TensorFlow 2.x
NumPy
Matplotlib

# Results
The multi-layer perceptron model achieved higher accuracy compared to the single-layer perceptron. Below are the accuracy results after 5 epochs:

Single-layer perceptron: 86.73%
Multi-layer perceptron: Higher accuracy as additional layers help in capturing more complex patterns.
# Conclusion
This project illustrates the importance of multi-layer networks in improving model performance for image classification tasks. The MNIST dataset is an excellent starting point for experimenting with neural networks.
